    </ul>

    <h2>How to cook?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar. Make a well in the center and add the olive oil and warm water. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, prepare the topping by combining the ground lamb or beef, chopped onion, tomatoes, tomato paste, parsley, minced garlic, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into smaller portions and roll each portion into thin rounds, about 1/8 inch thick. Place the dough rounds onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat topping mixture onto each dough round, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Bake the lahmacun in the preheated oven for about 8-10 minutes or until the edges are crispy and the meat is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the lahmacun from the oven and let them cool slightly. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
        <li>For a traditional serving, you can roll up the lahmacun with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a drizzle of tahini sauce or garlic sauce.</li>
    </ol>
