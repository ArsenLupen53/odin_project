    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Ground beef or Italian sausage(optional)</li>
        <li>Onion,garlic and other desired vegetables(optional)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce or marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Shredded mozaarella cheese</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs like basil or parsley(optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to tase</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to cook?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature indicated on the lasagna noodle package (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
        <li>If using ground beef or Italian sausage, cook it in a skillet over medium heat until browned. Add onions, garlic, and any other desired vegetables and cook until they are softened.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato sauce or marinara sauce into the skillet with the cooked meat and vegetables. Add salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes to let the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the instructions on the package. Usually, this involves boiling them in a large pot of salted water until they are al dente. Drain the noodles and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to layer the lasagna. Start by spreading a thin layer of sauce at the bottom of a baking dish to prevent sticking. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a generous amount of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, alternating between noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese until you've used up all the ingredients. The final layer should be sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it's tightly sealed. This will help the lasagna cook evenly and prevent excessive browning.</li>
        <li>Place the lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This will make it easier to slice and serve.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs if desired. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
