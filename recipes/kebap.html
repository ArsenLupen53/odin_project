        A kebab is a grilled or roasted dish featuring tender, marinated meat cooked on skewers. 
        With a tantalizing aroma and a caramelized exterior, each bite offers a burst of flavor and a tender, juicy experience. 
        Served with accompaniments like rice, pita bread, vegetables, and sauces, kebabs create a complete and satisfying meal. 
        Whether enjoyed at a street market or in the comfort of your own space, kebabs provide a delightful adventure for the taste buds.

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat of your choice (chicken, beef, lamb, or a combination)</li>
        <li>Marinade (can vary based on your preferences, but commonly includes olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, herbs, and spices)</li>
        <li>Skewers (metal or wooden, if using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent burning)</li>
        <li>Optional: Vegetables for skewering (such as bell peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to cook?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat into evenly sized chunks, ensuring they are not too thick to cook through evenly on the grill.</li>
        <li>Prepare the marinade by combining olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, herbs (such as oregano, thyme, or rosemary), spices (like paprika, cumin, or chili powder), salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well to create a flavorful marinade.</li>
        <li>Place the meat pieces in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over them. Ensure all the meat is coated evenly. If using wooden skewers, you can soak them in water during this time.</li>
        <li>Marinate the meat for at least 1-2 hours, or ideally overnight in the refrigerator. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat and tenderize it.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat or preheat your oven broiler.</li>
        <li>If using wooden skewers, remove them from the water and pat them dry. Skewer the marinated meat onto the skewers, alternating with any desired vegetables.</li>
        <li>Place the skewers on the preheated grill or under the broiler in the oven. Cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until the meat is cooked through and has a nicely charred exterior.</li>
        <li>Check for doneness by cutting into a piece of meat to ensure it's no longer pink and the juices run clear. Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the meat and the heat of your grill or broiler.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the kebabs from the grill or oven and let them rest for a few minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute and the meat to become more tender</li>
        <li>Serve the kebabs hot, either directly from the skewers or removed from the skewers and arranged on a platter. You can garnish with fresh herbs and serve with sides like rice, pita bread, salad, or tzatziki sauce for a complete meal.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bon appetit!</h3>
